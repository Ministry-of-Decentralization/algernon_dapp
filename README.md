Algernon is a layer 2 blockchain dapp which uses the blockchain as the source of truth data layer and centralized components to improve usability.


## Create Content
allow users to create semi-structured content with some of the data stored directly on chain and the rest of the data stored offchain with a hash of the data stored on chain.

## Curate Content (TCR)
allow users to stake tokens against content to help other users find quality content and to earn additional tokens
